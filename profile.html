**Name:** Daniel Beilfuss

**Profile Picture:** *(Imagine a spirited picture with you, probably at a coding desk with a few books and a rubber duck beside you)*

**Skills:**
- Swift Programming Mastery
- Web Dev Magic (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Public Speaking & Guidance (Thanks to my pastoring days)
- Picking up and piecing together coding challenges like they're puzzles.

**Interests:**
- Crafting elegant iOS apps with Swift. There's something satisfying about seeing my code come alive on a mobile screen.
- Diving deep into coding techniques, best practices, and those nifty tricks that make all the difference.
- Reflecting on spiritual teachings and finding parallels in the coding world. Who knew pastoring and programming had so much in common?
- Engaging in late-night coding sessions with my trusty rubber duck. He's quite the debugger!

**Career Goals:**
- Become the go-to person for Swift development, and maybe even teach a few courses or workshops.
- I'm on a mission to bridge the spiritual guidance from my pastoring days with the logical realm of coding. There's an app idea there, I just know it!
- And, while I'm learning and growing, I dream of building a community platform that supports both budding coders and those seeking spiritual insights. Why not blend the two?

**A Little More About Me:**
From the pulpit to the IDE, my journey's been anything but typical. As a pastor, I discovered the art of guiding souls. As a coder, I uncovered the beauty of crafting digital experiences. Funny enough, I find both worlds connected. Each line of code, much like every sermon, carries a message, a purpose. And while I might have dipped my toes in the banking world (you know, to keep the lights on), my heart and soul are intertwined between scriptures and scripts. So, here's to the wild journey of pastoring and programming! Oh, and if you ever want to chat about Swift, life, or the mysteries of the universe, just holler. I've got a rubber duck that loves a good conversation.
