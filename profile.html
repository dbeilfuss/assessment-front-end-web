            <h2>Who is Dan?</h2>
          <p>
            From the pulpit to the IDE, my journey's been anything but typical.
            As a pastor, I discovered the art of guiding souls. As a coder, I've
            uncovered the beauty of crafting digital experiences. Funny enough,
            both worlds seem to speak to who I am. Each line of code, much like
            every sermon, carries a message, a purpose. And while I might have
            dipped my toes in the banking world (you know, to keep the lights
            on), my heart and soul are intertwined between scriptures and
            scripts. So, here's to the wild journey of pastoring and
            programming! Oh, and if you ever want to chat about Swift, life, or
            the mysteries of the universe, just holler. I've got a rubber duck
            that loves a good conversation.

            <li>
              Elegant iOS apps with Swift. There's something satisfying about
              seeing my code beautifully come alive on a mobile screen.
            </li>
            <li>
              Diving deep into coding techniques, best practices, and those
              nifty tricks that make all the difference.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reflecting on spiritual teachings, philosphy, and finding
              parallels in the coding world. Who knew pastoring and programming
              had so much in common?
            </li>
            <li>
              Engaging in late-night coding sessions with my trusty rubber duck.
              He's quite the debugger!

                    </li>
                    <li>I'm on a mission to bridge the spiritual guidance from my pastoring days with the logical realm of coding. There's an app idea there, I just know it!
                    </li>
                    <li>And, while I'm learning and growing, I dream of building a community platform that supports both budding coders and those seeking spiritual insights. Why not blend the two?
